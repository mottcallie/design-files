design-files
============================================
Repository of the [Wilson Lab](http://wilson.med.harvard.edu) design files.

## terminology:
* "holders" aka "foils" are small pieces of metal that are cut to hold flies. We typically use thin stainless steel shim stock, or titanium foil, see below for more information.
* "platforms" are the larger holders that typically have a holder/foil on them, though we also have others

## holder-profiles
* Set of fly profiles that can be milled, etched or laser-cut from standard shim stock 
* The standard material is 0.001" full hard temper stainless steel shim stock ordered from McMaster
* New designs are sent to Etchit (Dentim) for etching http://www.etchitmn.com/
* Note some are hand folded after 2D profile is cut, as demonstrated in some of the older versioned inventor files

## platforms
* Fit the holders from holder-profiles and are convenient for physiology and behavior
* These are simply a copy of the Wilson lab standard holders in use,
* The central circle supports a smaller piece of cut plastic with the shim stock holders (above) and an O-ring to hold the saline

## 2-photon adapters
* adapters for various parts on a 2-photon, contact one of us for more details
